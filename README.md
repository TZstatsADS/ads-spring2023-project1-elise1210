### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: What words are most frequently mentioned by philosophers？
+ This project is conducted by Fei Xue

+ Project summary: This report is about interesting findings from kaggle philosophy_data aims for knowing frequency of words mentioned the most by different schools and different authors. Firstly,I process the raw data 'philosophy_data.csv'; then by cleaning data, removing stopwords and creating a tidy version of texts, I extracted three authors's sentences, Aristotle, Ricardo and Plato. I also extracted sentences by different schools: Aristotle, Plato, Capitalism. Then,I used histograms and word cloud to do the visualization to draw conclusion for this report.  

+ Three sections are explained in the report:

i.Comparison of words frequency between philosophers.  

ii.Among three famous philosophers, which words they used frequently?  

iii.Compare words frequency mentioned by different schools.
